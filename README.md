# 2.Computer_Network_Project
This project simulates basic network routing algorithms using Java in IntelliJ. It allows users to visualize network nodes, paths, and the routing process between different nodes. The goal is to understand how data packets are transferred efficiently using routing algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
